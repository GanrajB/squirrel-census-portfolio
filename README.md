# 🐿️ Central Park Squirrel Census – Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science & Analytics portfolio project based on the **2018 Central Park Squirrel Census** dataset. This project explores ecological behavior, environmental health, and species trends using advanced **EDA, visualization, mapping, and statistical insights**.

## 📊 Project Summary

This project is a deep-dive analysis of over 3,000 squirrel observations in Central Park, New York, with an aim to uncover:

- Population trends across locations and shifts (Morning/Evening)
- Age and fur color distribution
- Behavioral insights like foraging, running, and social interactions
- Environmental stress vs eco-positivity per plot
- Ideal plots and timings for squirrel observations

## 🗂️ Dataset

- 📁 Source: [2018 Squirrel Census - NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/)
- 📌 Format: CSV
- 🐿️ Records: ~3,000+ individual squirrel sightings

## 🧪 Key Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling NaN values, standardizing categories
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas
- **Geospatial Mapping:** Folium-based interactive maps
- **Plot-level Comparison:** Net Eco Index = Eco Score - Stress Score
- **Time/Shift Analysis:** Shift-based squirrel behaviors
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Correlations among activities like Foraging, Chasing, and Interactions

## 🌍 Project Highlights

### 1. Interactive Map: Central Park Squirrel Sightings
An interactive **Folium map** visualizing squirrel density across Central Park, zoomed to plot-level precision.

### 2. Age & Fur Color Analysis
Visual insights into how fur colors (Gray, Cinnamon, Black) vary with age (Juvenile/Adult).

### 3. Eco Index per Plot
Metric:  
`Net Eco Index = Eco Score - Stress Score`  
Helps rank plots by ecological friendliness.

### 4. Deep Dive: Plot 8
Chosen as an ideal plot for observation based on:
- High squirrel count
- Balanced behavior
- Strong eco-positive index
